# DeepPore: Automated Detection and Analysis of Congnitive Sweat Pore Activation using Neural Networks on Thermal Imaging Video

## Projecet Motivation:
This project demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring sweat pore activation (SPA) through thermal imaging video and deep neural networks as a measure of human performance during breathing and physical tasks. Our investigation addresses three key questions: 
1. Can deep learning models accurately detect sweat pore activation in thermal imaging while minimizing false positive? 
2. Does sweat pore activation correlate with breathing and physical movement?
3.
